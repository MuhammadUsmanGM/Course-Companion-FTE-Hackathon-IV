## 🚀 Executive Overview

The **Course Companion FTE** is a revolutionary AI-Native Educational platform designed to operate as a 24/7 Digital Full-Time Equivalent (FTE). By implementing the **Agent Factory Architecture**, this solution delivers a high-quality, personalized tutoring experience at **1% of the cost** of traditional human tutors.

This project was built for the **Panaversity Agent Factory Hackathon IV**, demonstrating a selective hybrid intelligence model that masterfully balances deterministic reliability with advanced LLM reasoning.

## 💎 Core Philosophy: Zero-Backend-LLM

Our architecture adheres to a strict **Zero-Backend-LLM Default** for all core educational services (Phase 1). This ensures:
- **Zero Latency:** Deterministic responses for lessons and navigation.
- **Verbatim Accuracy:** Content is delivered exactly as authored, preventing LLM hallucinations.
- **Extreme Cost Efficiency:** Primary tutoring workflows incur $0 in backend LLM costs.
