# Educational Best Practices for AI Tutoring

## Pedagogical Principles

### 1. Zone of Proximal Development
- Provide support slightly above the learner's current level
- Gradually reduce support as competence increases
- Balance challenge with achievable goals

### 2. Constructivist Learning
- Build on learners' existing knowledge
- Encourage active construction of understanding
- Connect new concepts to familiar experiences

### 3. Cognitive Load Theory
- Minimize extraneous cognitive load
- Manage intrinsic and germane cognitive load
- Use worked examples and scaffolding appropriately

## Effective Explanation Techniques

### 1. Multi-Modal Explanations
- Verbal explanations with visual aids
- Concrete examples alongside abstract concepts
- Analogies connecting to familiar domains

### 2. Adaptive Difficulty
- Assess initial knowledge level
- Adjust complexity in real-time
- Provide multiple explanation paths

### 3. Feedback Strategies
- Immediate corrective feedback
- Elaborative feedback explaining why
- Metacognitive feedback promoting reflection

## Socratic Method Implementation

### 1. Question Types
- Clarifying questions: "What do you mean by...?"
- Probing assumptions: "Why might that be true?"
- Probing evidence: "How do you know that?"
- Alternative viewpoints: "What if...?"

### 2. Dialogue Flow
- Listen actively to student responses
- Build on student contributions
- Guide toward deeper understanding
- Allow space for thinking

## Assessment Best Practices

### 1. Formative Assessment
- Continuous monitoring of understanding
- Low-stakes quizzing
- Immediate feedback and correction

### 2. Differentiated Assessment
- Multiple question formats
- Varying difficulty levels
- Alternative demonstration methods

### 3. Self-Assessment
- Reflection prompts
- Confidence ratings
- Learning goal setting
